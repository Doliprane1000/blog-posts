# My blog

Inspired by Phenomic and Next.js.

The pages are entirely built in React and then compiled in a static website.

No hot reload whatsoever. If needed, I switch to a temporary create-react-app environment.

I tried to focus on performance as much as I could.

## Scripts

```
npm run build
```
